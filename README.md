- [Register and Login Monk](https://docs.monk.io/docs/acc-and-auth)
- [Add Cloud Provider](https://docs.monk.io/docs/cloud-provider)
- [Add Instance](https://docs.monk.io/docs/multi-cloud)

### Make sure monkd is running.

``` bash
foo@bar:~$ monk status
daemon: ready
auth: logged in
not connected to cluster
```

### Clone Repository

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:CuteAnonymousPanda/monk-bird.git
```

### Update configuration

This template has very basic Bird configuration and will start a running copy of Bird, however it is most desired that you would update it with the configuration you would need.
To do so edit the `manifest.yaml` and in the `files` section replace the config provided with yours.
You could also use a `contents: <<< bird.conf` notation to read the contents of the file instead of providing it in-line.

### Load Template

``` bash
cd monk-bird
monk load manifest.yaml
```

### Verify if it's loaded correctly

``` bash
$ monk list -l bird
âœ” Got the list
